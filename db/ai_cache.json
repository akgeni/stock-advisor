      "guidelines": "NO. • Right-of-way clearances for new tower sites remain slow but not stricter • EMF radiation norms unchanged since 2021 • No fresh levy on tower companies in 2025-26 Budget • DoT’s 5G roll-out obligations actually favour tenancies",
      "future": "Bullish. • 5G tenancies still ramping; only ~35% of sites 5G-ready • Vi’s survival removes major churn risk (30% of Indus tenancies) • Tenancy-addition CAGR guidance 4-5% vs 2% last 3 yrs • Risk: Fibreisation lag could cap upside after FY27",
      "lifecycle": "**Growth**. Tower sector still adding ~8-10k new tenancies p.a.; 5G wave + rural 4G fill-in keeps growth above GDP; not yet a zero-sum game.",
      "bcg": "**Star**. High market share (33% of India’s towers), double-digit EBITDA growth (12% FY25), ROCE >20% and still gaining share as new co-locations outpace new builds.",
      "priceDrivers": "Up 29% in 3 mths → Vi cleared AGR dues (removes bankruptcy overhang), Citi & NDTV stories flag Vi revival = tenancy rebound, MF buying (15 funds added in Nov) + short-covering. No earnings miss; street pricing in 5-6% tenancy growth for FY26 vs 2% in FY25.",
      "governance": "⚠️ Red flags: 1) 68% promoter (Bharti + Vodafone) block; independent directors only 3/8 → limited dissent 💡 2) Related-party rev 35% (Vi + Airtel) → pricing scrutiny risk 3) Auditor change FY23 without clear reason 4) Auditor flagged ₹1,070 cr dues from Vi (now partly paid) yet no provisioning 💰 5) No whistle-blower case disclosure since FY21 → opacity. Management quality: Ops team ex-Bharti, execution strong; disclosure culture lags best-in-class."

      "guidelines": "YES\n• RBI caps leverage (NOF-to-Net-Owned-Fund ≤ 4×) and sectoral exposure limits\n• Daily asset-quality reporting (GNPA > 5% triggers PCA) \n• 15% mandatory priority-sector lending quota",
      "future": "Bullish 📈\n• Rising credit demand from MSMEs & gold loans post-COVID\n• Govt push for NBFC co-lending with banks = low-cost funds\n• Risk: Fast rate hikes → ALM mismatch & higher NPAs",
      "lifecycle": "**Growth**<br>NBFC space still gaining share from banks; digital sourcing, niche products (gold, infra, microfinance) keep runway long.",
      "bcg": "**Question Mark**<br>High growth (30% m-cap jump) but RoA <2%, scale still small vs banks; needs capital to capture share or slips to Dog.",
      "priceDrivers": "Up 30% on BICCello acquisition buzz & 52-wk high momentum; promoter partly exited (₹1,165 cr Aug) yet market ignoring dilution on M&A optimism.",
      "governance": "Red flag 🚩: Promoter sold 2.7% stake at discount without prior intimation; limited indie directors & no woman director yet. Acquisition funded via debt → minority squeeze risk."

      "guidelines": "NO 🚫\n• FSSAI quality norms on edible oils are standard, not growth killers\n• Import duty tweaks on CPO/soft oils swing margins but are predictable\n• PLI scheme for oilseeds & export incentives actually help domestic crushers",
      "future": "Bullish 📈\n• India’s 23 MMT import dependency → huge localisation runway\n• Rising per-capita fat consumption + packaged food boom\n• Soft-oil seed yields improving via GM mustard & better MSP",
      "lifecycle": "**Growth** 🌱\nCapacity additions, new product lines (rice-bran, sunflower), regional brand roll-outs and frequent capex point to a classic growth phase, not yet consolidation.",
      "bcg": "**Question Mark** ❓\nDouble-digit volume growth but EBITDA margins <6% and pan-India brand equity still low; needs cash to scale or risks slipping to ‘Dog’ if commodity squeeze persists.",
      "priceDrivers": "50% “drop” on 14 Oct was 2:1 split, not loss. Post-split nominal price doubled liquidity; sentiment lifted 26% in Dec on strong Q2 volume jump and bonus chatter, not EPS beat.",
      "governance": "Red flags 🚩\nPromoter pledge >45% of holding; frequent related-party raw-material deals; auditor resignation last FY citing ‘limited access’ to inventory data. Board reappoints CFO as whole-time director despite past SEBI consent order on insider rules—signals weak oversight."
