      "guidelines": "NO. \n• Right-of-way clearances still slow, but tower cos now get deemed approvals if states miss 60-day deadline 🚀\n• No price caps on tower rentals; only TRAI QoS norms on uptime & diesel use 📡\n• 5G roll-out obligations on telcos = forced tenancy demand for Indus, so policy tailwind, not headwind ✅",
      "future": "**Bullish** 📈\n• Data traffic CAGR 35% & 5G densification = 25-30% more tenancies per site over 3 yrs 🌐\n• Vi’s AGR relief removes bankruptcy risk; 95k overdue sites now monetisable 💰\n• Risk: if Vi still can’t raise $10bn capex, tenancy ramp could stall ⚠️",
      "lifecycle": "**Growth** 🌱\nPenetration <55%, 5G still rolling, tenancy ratio <2x vs 2.5x global best; decade-long runway before saturation.",
      "bcg": "**Star** ⭐\nHigh market share (34% of towers), double-digit EBITDA growth, heavy cash generation reinvested in new towers & fiber; not yet mature enough to be Cash Cow."
